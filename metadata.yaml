description: '"World War I, in the background of Rebecca West''s first novel, was
  "the first war that women could imagine," writes Samuel Hynes in his eloquent introduction,
  "and so it was the first that a woman could write into a novel." Narrated by a woman
  who, like West, has never experienced war and yet for whom the war was very real,
  The Return of the Soldier (1918) takes place not on a battlefield, but in an isolated
  country house. It examines the relationships between three women and a soldier suffering
  from shell shock. This novel of an enclosed world invaded by public events also
  embodies in its characters the shifts in England''s class structures at the beginning
  of the twentieth century, as well as the choice between the romantic past and the
  horrifying present, between love and reality."'
